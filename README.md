# Chemogenetic tuning reveals optimal MAPK signaling for cell-fate programming
This repo contains all data analysis and code to create the figures in https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.19.629350

# Python setup
1. Create a virtual environment in the repository directory using python -m venv env
2. Activate the virtual environment using source env/bin/activate (MacOS, Linux) or .\env\Scripts\activate (Windows)
3. Install the current package versions for this project using pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Download the raw and analyzed data from Zenodo (DOI: ___), specifically the data.zip file. Unzip this file.
5. Create a file in the root directory of the repo called datadir.txt that contains the absolute path to the data directory you just downloaded. This should be a single line.
